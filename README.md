# Projects
Welcome to my Projects repository!

This collection showcases various projects that demonstrate core concepts in **IT and Networking**, with a focus on **Cisco networking, routing, switching, VLANs, dynamic routing protocols (like OSPF)**, and more. These hands-on labs reflect the skills and knowledge gained during my journey to earn the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification.

Each folder contains a self-contained project, complete with:
- 📘 Project overview and objectives
- 🖥️ Network topology diagrams
- 🔧 Configuration files (routers, switches, PCs)
- 🧪 GNS3 simulation files

These projects are designed for learning, demonstration, and practical reinforcement of enterprise networking principles.

Feel free to explore and clone any project. Feedback and collaboration are welcome!

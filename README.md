# Projects
Welcome to my Projects repository!

This collection showcases various projects that demonstrate core concepts in **IT and Networking**, with a focus on **Cisco networking, routing, switching, VLANs, dynamic routing protocols (like OSPF)**, and more. These hands-on labs reflect the skills and knowledge gained during my journey to earn the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** certification.

Each folder contains a self-contained project, complete with:
- 📘 Project overview and objectives
- 🖥️ Network topology diagrams
- 🔧 Configuration files (routers, switches, PCs)

These projects are designed for learning, demonstration, and practical reinforcement of enterprise networking principles.

Feel free to explore and clone any project. Feedback and collaboration are welcome!
